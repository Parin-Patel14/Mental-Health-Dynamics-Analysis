# Mental-Health-Dynamics-Analysis
A data-driven analysis of mental health trends using machine learning and statistical methods on DASS scores.

##Overview:
This project investigates the relationship between personality traits, demographic factors, and mental health outcomes using statistical techniques and machine learning models. The study aims to predict mental health conditions, assess intervention effectiveness, and analyze Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales (DASS) scores using SPSS & Python.

## Objectives:
âœ… Evaluate the impact of personality traits (Ten Item Personality Inventory - TIPI) on DASS scores.
âœ… Analyze the effectiveness of a mental health intervention program by comparing pre/post-intervention DASS scores.
âœ… Determine the statistical significance of demographic factors (age, gender, education) on mental health.
âœ… Develop predictive machine learning models to classify mental health severity.

## Key Statistics & Findings:
### Dataset:
39,775 responses from Kaggleâ€™s DASS dataset.
Responses categorized into 5 mental health severity levels:
ðŸ”¹ Normal
ðŸ”¹ Mild
ðŸ”¹ Moderate
ðŸ”¹ Severe
ðŸ”¹ Extremely Severe
### Machine Learning Model Performance:
Logistic Regression â†’ Accuracy: 74%, Precision: 78%, Recall: 96% (Best performing model)
Support Vector Machine (SVM) â†’ Accuracy: 71%
Random Forest â†’ Accuracy: 71%
### Statistical Analysis (SPSS ANOVA Results):
p-value < 0.001 â†’ Significant correlation between TIPI4 (Anxiety Trait) and DASS scores.
Age & Gender significantly influence mental health outcomes.
Intervention program showed a 15% reduction in average DASS scores.
### Hypothesis Testing:
ANOVA confirmed TIPI scores are significant predictors of mental health severity.
Technologies & Tools Used:
ðŸ”¹ Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
ðŸ”¹ SPSS (Statistical Hypothesis Testing)
ðŸ”¹ CRISP-DM Data Science Methodology
ðŸ”¹ Machine Learning (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest)
ðŸ”¹ GitHub for version control & collaboration

 Future Scope:
ðŸ”¹ Implement deep learning models (LSTMs) for enhanced prediction accuracy.
ðŸ”¹ Expand dataset with real-world intervention case studies.
ðŸ”¹ Develop an interactive dashboard for real-time mental health monitoring.
